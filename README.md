# The Hairy Potter

In this project, your task to build a workflow for making, and firing pottery, and then determining if it should be sold at a craft show. Then you will display the pottery to be sold in the DOM.

> 🧨 Make sure you answer the vocabulary and understanding questions at the end of this document before notifying your coaches that you are done with the project

## Setup

```sh
cd hairy-potter
cd src
code .
```

1. Run the `serve` command to start the web server.
1. Open the URL provided by `serve` in your browser.

## Requirements

### Making Pottery at the Wheel

1. Create a `scripts/PotteryWheel.js` module.
1. Define a variable in the module to have the value of the primary key for each piece of pottery. It should have an initial value of 1.
1. Define and export a function named `makePottery`.
1. The `makePottery` function must accept the following values as input _(i.e. it needs parameters)_, in the following order.
   1. Shape of the piece of pottery (e.g. "Mug", "Platter")
   1. Weight of the piece (e.g. 1, 5)
   1. Height of the piece (e.g. 3, 7)
1. The `makePottery` function must return an object with the following properties on it.
   1. `shape`
   1. `weight`
   1. `height`
   1. `id` _(increment this value each time the function is invoked)_

#### Checking Your Work

In the `main.js` module, invoke the `makePottery` function and provide the required values as arguments. Store the object that gets returned into a variable, and then use `console.log()` to view the object.

Once you have it working, make 5 pieces of pottery in `main.js`.

### Firing the Pottery in the Kiln

1. Define a `scripts/Kiln.js` module.
1. Define and export a function named `firePottery` that is responsible for acting as a kiln.
1. The function must accept the following values as input _(i.e. it needs parameters)_, in the following order. If you don't remember, you can easily [add new properties to objects in JavaScript](https://www.dyn-web.com/tutorials/object-literal/properties.php).
   1. An object representing a piece of pottery that was made at the wheel in the `makePottery` function.
   1. A number specifying the firing temperature of the kiln.
1. The function must add a new property of `fired` with the value of `true` to the object.
1. The function must add a new property of `cracked` to the object.
   1. If the temperature of the kiln is above 2200 degrees then `cracked` property must have a value of `true`.
   1. If the temperature of the kiln is at, or below, 2200 degrees then `cracked` property must have a value of `false`.
1. After both of the new properties have been added, return the augmented object.

#### Checking Your Work

In the `main.js` module, invoke the `firePottery` function for each of the 5 pieces of pottery you created. Ensure you provide the required values as arguments. Store the object that gets returned into a variable, and then use `console.log()` to view the objects and make sure it has the right properties on each.

To check your work, make sure that at least one of your pieces of pottery is fired at a temperature that is too high.

### Pricing Uncracked Pottery

1. Create a `scripts/PotteryCatalog.js` module.
1. Define a variable in the module with a value of an empty array. This array will store pottery that will be sold. Do not export this array.
1. Define and export a function named `toSellOrNotToSell` that is responsible for determining if a piece of pottery should be sold.
1. The `toSellOrNotToSell` function must accept a pottery object as input.
1. If the weight of the piece of pottery is greater than, or equal to, 6 then the function must add a `price` property with a value of 40.
1. If the weight of the piece of pottery is less than 6 then the function must add a `price` property with a value of 20.
1. If the piece of pottery is cracked, do not add a `price` property to it.
1. If the pottery is **not** cracked, add the object to the module-level array of items to be sold.
1. Return the augmented object.
1. Define and export a function named `usePottery` returns a copy of the array of items to be sold. Recall which array method creates a copy of the array.

#### Checking Your Work

In the `main.js` module, invoke the `toSellOrNotToSell` function for each of the 5 pieces of pottery you created. Ensure you provide the required value as an argument.

### Display the Catalog

Your next task is to create HTML representations of the pottery you want to sell at the craft fair and display them on the DOM. Then you will track which ones you sell.

#### Define DOM Target

1. Create an `<article>` element in the `index.html` file.
1. The article element must have a class of `potteryList`.

#### Create Pottery HTML

1. Create a `scripts/PotteryList.js` module.
1. Define and export a `PotteryList` function.
1. The `PotteryList` function must get the items to be sold from the `PotteryCatalog.js` module.
1. The `PotteryList` function must convert each object in the array to an HTML representation string. Use the following template to generate the representations.
   ```html
   <section class="pottery" id="pottery--1">
     <h2 class="pottery__shape">Mug</h2>
     <div class="pottery__properties">
       Item weighs 3 grams and is 6 cm in height
     </div>
     <div class="pottery__price">Price is $20</div>
   </section>
   ```
1. The `PotteryList` function must then return a single string that contains ALL of the pottery HTML representation.

#### Checking Your Work

In the `main.js` module, invoke the `PotteryList` component function. Take its return value and update the inner HTML of the article element you created above. When you start your web server, you should see your non-cracked pottery list appear (_example below_).

## Vocabulary and Understanding

> 🧨 Before you click the "Assessment Complete" button on the Learning Platform, add your answers below for each question and make a commit. It is your option to request a face-to-face meeting with a coach for a vocabulary review.

1. Explain how you got the HTML, with the correct data, displayed in the browser?
   > Your answer here
2. In the **PotteryList** module, when you iterate your pottery, you need to show the evidence of what the **weight** property's value is for the 2nd piece of pottery. Use [Loom](https://www.loom.com/) to record your browser window with the developer tools open and show those values.
   > Paste your video's public URL here
3. The **PotteryWheel** module has a single function named `makePottery`. Why doesn't that module have all of the other code in it?
   > Your answer here
4. The pottery shop has learned that there is a set of customers that are willing to buy cracked pottery at a discounted price of $2.50. That means that the cracked pottery should now be displayed in the catalog. Explain the changes that this new business strategy would cause to your algorithm.
   > Your answer here
5. In the **Kiln** module, you have a `firePottery()` function. You need to demonstrate how to use the debugger to verify the values of the parameters for that function when your code runs. Use [Loom](https://www.loom.com/) to record your browser window with the developer tools open and show those values.
